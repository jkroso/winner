## Running the tests

Before you can run any tests you will need to execute `$ npm install`

Running the test in node is just a matter of executing `$ make test`

Running in the browser though requires a build. To do that execute `$ make test/built.js`. If all goes well you should then be able to open your browser to the test directory and watch the test suite run.

_Note: these commands don't work on windows._
