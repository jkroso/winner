# winner

Compare the items of an array and return the biggest

## Getting Started

__With component(1)__ 

`component install jkroso/winner`

__In Node.js__ 

`npm install jkroso/winner --save`

Then its a good idea to add winner to your `bundledDependencies` array in your package.json file if you are planning to publish. This is just until npm completes its support for github packages 

## API

```javascript
var winner = require('winner')
```
